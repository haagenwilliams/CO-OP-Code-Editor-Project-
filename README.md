# Real-Time Co-Op Code Editor

## Overview
This project is a real-time Co-Op code editor that will allow multiple users to edit the same code file at the same time. Something I think would be super helpful for classrooms and labs where you'd like to work together (Think of it as a less sophiscated github but realtime). It includes features like syntax highlighting, real-time chat, and code execution. Looking to add a code execution using Docker to run the code in isolated containers which would return the output. I would need to add a "Run" button in the frotend of the code to send the code to the API which could then diplay the result.

## Features
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the same code file in real time.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Supports JavaScript, Python, and Java.
- **Chat Feature**: Users can communicate while collaborating.
- **Code Execution**: Run and test code directly in the editor (coming soon).

 Simply just clone the repository with a the needed developer tool installed
